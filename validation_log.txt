In the Waiwera simulation, two reservoirs are being considered for investment: Geothermal A and Geothermal B. Both have different enthalpies of source input, with the conditions that:

1. Geothermal A has a higher temperature (35 degrees C) than Geothermal B. 
2. The total flow rate is 100 kg/s in both reservoirs.
3. The thermal energy generated by each reservoir is proportional to its enthalpy and temperature difference between their temperatures and the ambient temperature of 25 degree Celsius. 

The geologists have provided you with some information:
- Geothermal A's enthalpy is 1,200 kJ/kg while Geothermal B's enthalpy is 900 kJ/kg.
- The heat transfer coefficient (h) for both reservoirs is the same at 20 W/(m²K).
- The temperature difference between the geothermal reservoir and the ambient temperature is equal to the difference in their temperatures with the ambient temperature.

You need to calculate and compare:
1. How much energy each Geothermal reservoir will generate?
2. Which reservoir should be chosen for investment, considering only these parameters (enthalpy, flow rate, temperature difference).


First, calculate the heat transfer from each reservoir. The equation used is Q = hAΔT/L, where Q is the power output or energy generated, A is the surface area of the reservoir, ΔT is the temperature difference between the reservoir and the ambient, and L is the thickness (or depth) of the reservoir.

For Geothermal A: 
We have the flow rate (Q = m * CpΔT), where m is the flow rate (100 kg/s in this case), Cp is the specific heat capacity of water (4.18 MJ/(kg*K)), and ΔT is the temperature difference (35 - 25 = 10 degrees C).

For Geothermal B: 
We also have Q = m * CpΔT, where ΔT is now 30 - 25 = 5 degrees C since it has a lower enthalpy.

To calculate energy generated over time, we can simply divide the power output by 60 (to get the annual output).

Compare the energy generated by both reservoirs. The reservoir with higher energy generation should be chosen for investment.

The decision can also be influenced by other factors such as the cost of extraction from each reservoir, but for this puzzle we are only considering enthalpy, flow rate, and temperature difference.

Answer: 
1. Geothermal A will generate more energy than Geothermal B due to its higher enthalpy and temperature difference.
2. Thus, Geothermal A should be chosen for investment based on the parameters given.
